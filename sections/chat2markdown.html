        <a href="https://github.com/gdavidss/chat2markdown">chat2markdown</a> is an experimental chat app that allows you and your friends to modify all messages in the chat… all for the sake of a good markdown file.

      <p>Philosophical assumptions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://subconscious.substack.com/p/credible-exit">data shouldn’t exist in silos</a>
        </li>
        <li>chats are collective artifacts</li>
        <li>having all the knobs of a system is good sometimes</li>
        <br />
      </ul>
      <p>I built this app during my Software Engineering internship at Meta Platforms this summer. It was my very first time making an app and learning Objective-C.</p>
      <p>This project taught me many things. First, it taught me how to work in a semi-independent way. I got constant feedback from my manager and a project peer and worked hard to cultivate a harmonious, fun, and helpful relationship.</p>
      <p>Most importantly, however, I learned a lot about dealing with the arising complexity of programming. In fact, because the app worked as a regular messaging app while still allowing messages to be manipulated in all possible ways by both users in real-time conversation, I ran into many edge cases that forced me to redesign my data models multiple times.</p>
      <p>Putting on my self-critic hat, I think the app could have been better visually polished. It also still contains some bugs lurking around. This was largely due to the fact that I only spent about 6 weeks coding it, having started the internship with zero experience in iOS (and mobile development in general).</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, it was truly empowering to execute such a weird and quirky idea like this. I was genuinely motivated by giving life to the philosophical assumptions behind the app, giving birth to a new medium that no one had ventured to try before.</p>
