        <p>There&#39;s an obvious yet overlooked character about the fact that we are all systems existing within and around systems. As the months go by, I have been increasingly embodying the identity of being a &quot;self engineer&quot;—designing both my own personal systems and the interfaces with outer systems. Here are a few of my current physical ones</p>
        <p><strong>The Wisdom Wall</strong>  </p>
        <p>I was inspired by my friend Sam, from Harvard University, whom I met during my internship at Meta. Sam has over 1000 post-its with written pieces of wisdom glued on his wall—plus a digital version in Google sheets, in case he loses some or needs to recreate them. One interesting function the Wisdom Wall has for him is acting as a resiliency mechanism. So whenever life beats him up, he finds guidance in the pieces of wisdom he left on the wall.</p>
        <p>This curiously connects a lot with your take on <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Peripheral_vision">peripheral vision</a>, especially because the wall is highly dynamic. This dynamism especially shows up whenever one of the post-its inevitably falls down, offering a moment to read it with care before putting it back on the wall.</p>
        <p>Based on Sam—and modifying it my way—I have also been curating my own wisdom wall:</p>

        <p><strong>Objects queue</strong> </p>
        <p>Here I put here all objects I want to eventually bring to another room. Usually, this means mugs and bottles I feel too lazy to bring to the kitchen at the moment.</p>

        <p><strong>Variety absorption</strong></p>
        <p>Variety is a cybernetic concept that means &quot;all possible states of a system.&quot; When I don&#39;t know where to put an object or am just too lazy to put it in the right place, it goes right into variety absorption.</p>

        <p><strong>Shower in mirror</strong></p>
        <p>I often shave while showering, but I always have to fix the untrimmed parts in the sink. Gluing a 
        small mirror in the shower fixes this. I apply a layer of dried soap on the mirror to prevent it from fogging.</p>

        <p><strong>The metasystemic hub</strong></p>
        <p>Still trying to make sense of this one. I mostly use it as my interface for don&#39;t-break-the-chain habit trackers.</p>
