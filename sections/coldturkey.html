        <p>A huge chunk of the interactions I have with my computer happens through the <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/">Alfred Powerpack</a>. I use it on average 140 times a day—triggering custom snippets, workflows and keywords.</p>
        <p>One of the ways I use is as my own kind of programmable attention system. To do so, I trigger blocks in the Cold Turkey Blocker app—preventing me from accessing a collection of websites for a given amount of time.</p>
        <p>I built and published a Cold Turkey workflow for alfred, and it can be downloaded <a href="https://www.packal.org/workflow/cold-turkey-blocker">here</a>.</p>
