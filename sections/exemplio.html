        <p><a href="https://pdfhost.io/v/COUPOEjko_exemplio">exemplio</a> was an educational platform aimed at high school students in Brazil. Its value proposition was simple: to compile, dissect and disseminate stories of diverse role models to encourage young people. To do so, we had a page for each &quot;example,&quot; containing a podcast episode and a graphical timeline of their personal journey.  </p>
        <p>exemplio lived at <a href="https://exempl.io">https://exempl.io</a> (RIP) and contained around 20 &quot;examples&quot; of students. Its design was highly experimental—we even had to restart the project from scratch after having launched it for a couple of months. There were no interfaces like these, but I got a bit of inspiration from the design of <a href="https://my.headspace.com/">Headspace</a>.  </p>
        <p>The idea was cool, and I learned much from managing and shaping a project like this. In retrospect, though, I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve ever reached the scale we wanted. The premise of democratizing role models was pretty cool, but interviewing, adding descriptions, and generating code for each graphical timeline was too time-consuming, further preventing scale. We thought of &quot;decentralizing&quot; the process, allowing signed users to record their own personal journeys and input their timelines, but none of us were quite technically there back then.  </p>
        <p>&quot;Officially,&quot; I was considered a Head of Product. Which basically involved doing a little bit of all, like editing all podcasts, writing descriptions for each example, and — of course — helping to build the technical part of the project. Technically, I ideated all the UI/UX design using Adobe XD and contributed to the code using ReactJS, Javascript, SQL, CSS, and HTML.  </p>
